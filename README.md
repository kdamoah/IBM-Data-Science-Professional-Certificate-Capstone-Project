SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of USD62 million whereas other providers cost upward of USD165 million. Much of the savings is as a result of SpaceX reusing the first stage. Therefore, in the project, I predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
